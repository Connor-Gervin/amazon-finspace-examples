# Amazon FinSpace Examples. 
This repository contains example notebooks and python scripts that show how to work with [Amazon FinSpace](https://aws.amazon.com/finspace/).

## Examples

### Notebooks: Inside FinSpace

These notebooks are intended to be run from the FinSpace managed notebook environment.

- [Analyzing petabytes of trade and quote data with Amazon FinSpace](amazon-finspace-examples/notebooks/analyze_trade_and_quote_data/) shows how to use the FinSpace Time Series Library.  
- [Cluster Management](amazon-finspace-examples/notebooks/cluster_management/).  
- [Collect Timebars and Summarize](amazon-finspace-examples/notebooks/collect_timebars_and_summarize/).  
- [Compute and Plot Volatility from TAQ](amazon-finspace-examples/notebooks/compute_and_plot_volatility_from_taq/).  
- [Exploring FinSpace APIs](amazon-finspace-examples/notebooks/exploring_finspace_apis/).  
- [Working in FinSpace](amazon-finspace-examples/notebooks/WorkingInFinSpace/). 
- [Technical INdicators](amazon-finspace-examples/notebooks/technical_indicators/). 

### Notebooks: Outside FinSpace

These notebooks are intended to be run from outside of FinSpace. 

- [Putting Data into FinSpace](amazon-finspace-examples/notebooks/putting_data_into_finspace/). 
- [Remote Cluster Management](amazon-finspace-examples/notebooks/remote_cluster_management/)

### Python: Helper Code

- [Utility Classes](amazon-finspace-examples/notebooks/Utilities/) that are used on the notebooks that facilitate the use of the inSpace boto3 APIs.  

### Notebooks: Outside FinSpace
These notebooks are intended to be run from outside of FinSpace, communicating with the FinSpace service using the FinSpace APIs.

## FAQ

*How do I contribute my own example notebook?*

- Although we're extremely excited to receive contributions from the community, we're still working on the best mechanism to take in examples from external sources.  Please bear with us in the short-term if pull requests take longer than expected or are closed.
